There once was a little boy who lived in a shed.
He always want to leave, but the world was all dead.

The world was so quiet. He couldn't here any noise.
He was so hungry. He had to venture beyond the safety of the small doors.
He reached out, but the doors opened by themselves.
A person stood there. They looked astonished at what they had found.

It was a rather large person. "But how could this be??", he thought.
"I am here because there's nothing outside."
The person reached out thier hand. Can they be trusted?
Their arms are dirty, thier hands are rough, and thier sleeves are ragged.
Past the arms...he saw a clean face with bright blue eyes...
He grabbed the grubby arm. He pulled himself out of the darkness.

Chapter 1:
The end of all time was upon him. He thought he would have already been dead. He was wrong!

Chapter 3:
He finally found time to start asking Abby what was going on. Why was she alive? Who else survived?
It turned out that it was all just an overreaction.
