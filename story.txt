There once was a little boy who lived in a shed.
He always want to leave, but the world was all dead.

The world was so quiet. He couldn't here any noise.
He was so hungry. He had to venture beyond the safety of the small doors.
He reached out, but the doors opened by themselves.
A person stood there. They looked astonished at what they had found.

Chapter 3:
He finally found time to start asking Abby what was going on. Why was she alive? Who else survived?
It turned out that it was all just an overreaction.
